Dear Doug,

Our members asked and LACA has responded!

Many of our members have asked to be texted about timely issues surrounding Lake Anna. Our board considered this additional communications method and decided to add texting as a way to get the word out to our members. LACA will continue to utilize E-Grams, Facebook Posts, Newsletters and the LACA Website. No Swim Advisories, Fireworks Cancelation, Legislative Issues or Important Community Meetings are the types of alerts that we will be sending via text.  

Our first text regarding the results from the most recent water quality testing will go out soon. To receive the text, you must make sure we have your cell number AND your consent to receive texts from LACA. To do so, please log into your profile on the [LACA website](https://www.lakeannavirginia.org/EmailTracker/LinkTracker.ashx?linkAndRecipientCode=F4hwJ%2fcQ99PhBDAA%2bd9UN%2bWa5IjVFnB1bjfdl5XAoSFza4sE5WJsGoSColSm0qRquBwNnoSiBwEP7d%2bZAbcAStc8K2nUFLrKQx%2bgQCiSC%2fc%3d) and be sure that your cell phone is entered AND you have checked the Consent Text Box.

Dear Doug,

We are looking for volunteers! 

As David Reichert reported in the March newsletter [Lake Anna Civic Association - LACA Wins a DuPont Clear into the Future Grant (lakeannavirginia.org)](https://www.lakeannavirginia.org/EmailTracker/LinkTracker.ashx?linkAndRecipientCode=TMaI%2fSrhfiVAKLm%2ffvhwtGnegVtP9E6YYcO5A5vg%2bCBDVhPUhmMm7vWIfyABRDlpm9c57YIap%2b7y6%2bjVHtrP9s9Ncl5ZGEyaFzz8zXh8hQ0%3d), LACA won a nearly $10,000 grant from DuPont to be used for educational outreach, to purchase and plant native flora and to measure the impact of these plantings on the local water quality. The goal is to start creating a self-sustaining natural filter for the nutrients that otherwise would enter the lake and cause harmful algae blooms.

LACA members planted the first of these native plants at the home of Ken and Val Quaglio on April 19. We were joined by students from Anna Burkett's Biology class at Louisa County High School. In addition to learning about Lake Anna water quality, native invertebrates and plants, and doing a scavenger hunt, the students planted about 200 native plants along the shoreline. These include Fringed Sedge, Softstem Bulrush, and Broadleaf Arrowhead. Each of these plants are excellent for absorbing nitrogen and phosphorous from the lake, with the added benefit of attracting mosquito-eating dragonflies.

We have another planting scheduled for May 6, 2023 at 9:00am in the common area of the Clearview Shores community.  This area is across the water from Lake Anna State Park and will be a great location for drawing attention to the shoreline vegetation project. We are looking for about 10 volunteers to help get the plants in the ground. Planting moves pretty quickly, as the plants come to us as 5-inch plugs so we expect to be finished by noon. We can provide all the needed tools, as well as waders for those who will be planting just below the waterline.

We are also seeking landowners who would be interested in having native plants placed along or just below their shoreline. We'll be giving priority to those landowners in parts of the lake most affected by HAB. The DuPont funding will provide the plants, so there is no cost to you.

If you are interested in learning more about the benefits of these shoreline plants, would like to volunteer for May 6 or future plantings, or have property where we could plant, please contact Lara Weatherholtz ([lara.weatherholtz@​lakeannavirginia.org](mailto:lara.weatherholtz@lakeannavirginia.org)) or Mark DeBord ([Mark.Debord@lakeannavirginia.​org](mailto:Mark.Debord@lakeannavirginia.org)), co-chairs of LACA's Environmental Preservation Committee.





Thanks,

Mark and Lara
